RISC-V GNU Toolchain should be installed to "{root}/opt/riscv/", such that the path "{root}/opt/riscv/bin/" is created.
See toolchain process documentation for installation guidance.
The toolchain has been omitted from git for now due to its size (2+ GB), but we may include/package it in a release version.
